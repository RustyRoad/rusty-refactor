# Modular Analyzer Refactoring

## Overview
The monolithic `RustCodeAnalyzer` class has been refactored into four focused, single-responsibility modules with high cohesion and loose coupling.

## Module Architecture

### 1. **SymbolExpander** (`symbolExpander.ts`)
**Responsibility:** Symbol-aware code selection expansion using VS Code's symbol provider API

**Key Methods:**
- `getCompleteSymbolsAtSelection()` - Expands selection to complete symbol boundaries
- `findOverlappingSymbols()` - Recursively finds symbols overlapping the selection, including parent context
- `rangesOverlap()` - Checks if symbol ranges overlap with user selection
- `findAttributeStart()` - Scans upward to include all attributes and traits (#[...], ///, etc.)

**Why It's Cohesive:**
- All methods work toward a single goal: expanding selections to complete symbols
- Isolated from parsing, analysis, and context detection
- Uses only VS Code's symbol provider API

### 2. **RustCodeParser** (`rustCodeParser.ts`)
**Responsibility:** Regex-based parsing of Rust code elements

**Key Methods:**
- `parseFunctions()` - Extract function definitions
- `parseStructs()` - Extract struct definitions
- `parseFields()` - Extract struct fields
- `parseEnums()` - Extract enum definitions
- `parseTraits()` - Extract trait definitions
- `parseImplementations()` - Extract impl blocks and methods
- `extractBlock()` - Extract brace-delimited blocks
- `extractImports()` - Extract use statements
- `extractTypesFromSignature()` - Extract types from signatures

**Why It's Cohesive:**
- All methods parse different Rust constructs using regex patterns
- No analysis or interpretation—just extraction
- Stateless and reusable across contexts

### 3. **CodeAnalyzer** (`codeAnalyzer.ts`)
**Responsibility:** Semantic analysis of code properties and relationships

**Key Methods:**
- `detectUsedTypes()` - Identify non-standard types in code
- `detectUsedTraits()` - Identify trait bounds and implementations
- `hasGenerics()` - Check for generic parameters
- `determineVisibility()` - Determine pub/pub(crate)/private visibility

**Why It's Cohesive:**
- All methods analyze semantic properties independent of structure
- Works with already-parsed data
- Focused on type and trait relationships

### 4. **ImplContextDetector** (`implContextDetector.ts`)
**Responsibility:** Detect and extract impl block context

**Key Methods:**
- `detectImplContext()` - Find impl block containing the selection
- `findBlockEnd()` - Find matching closing brace

**Why It's Cohesive:**
- Specialized for impl block detection only
- Uses RustCodeParser for parsing methods
- Handles a single contextual concern

### 5. **RustCodeAnalyzer** (`analyzer.ts`) - Orchestrator
**Responsibility:** Coordinate the modules and provide a unified analysis interface

**Key Changes:**
- Simplified from 400+ lines to ~60 lines
- Creates instances of all four modules
- Delegates to appropriate modules
- Maintains `enrichWithRustAnalyzer()` for rust-analyzer integration

**Architecture Pattern:**
```
RustCodeAnalyzer (Orchestrator)
├── SymbolExpander (expand selection)
├── RustCodeParser (parse code)
├── CodeAnalyzer (analyze properties)
└── ImplContextDetector (detect context)
```

## Benefits of This Refactoring

### ✅ High Cohesion
- Each class has **one reason to change**
- Methods in each class are tightly related
- Each module is independently testable

### ✅ Loose Coupling
- Modules don't depend on each other
- Analyzer orchestrates composition
- Easy to swap implementations

### ✅ Reusability
- `RustCodeParser` can be used by other components
- `SymbolExpander` can handle different selection scenarios
- `CodeAnalyzer` can analyze any Rust code

### ✅ Maintainability
- Bug in symbol expansion? Check `SymbolExpander`
- Issue with parsing? Check `RustCodeParser`
- Problem with type detection? Check `CodeAnalyzer`
- Context detection issues? Check `ImplContextDetector`

### ✅ Testability
Each module can be unit tested independently with mock documents and selections

### ✅ Extensibility
Adding new features is isolated:
- New parsing logic → `RustCodeParser`
- New analysis → `CodeAnalyzer`
- New context types → New specialized detector

## Future Enhancements

- Add `DocCommentParser` for documentation analysis
- Add `DependencyResolver` for import analysis
